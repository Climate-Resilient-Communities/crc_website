          <h2>Non-Government Organizations (NGO) / Non-Profit Organizations (NPO)</h2>
          <p>
          At CRC, we understand the pivotal role that NGOs and NPOs play in fostering 
          positive change. Our project seeks to build alliances with NGOs and NPOs that 
          share our commitment to climate resilience, climate justice and community 
          empowerment. Specifically, we are interested in forging partnerships to address 
          issues related to negative climate events as well as chronic stressors (e.g., 
          poverty, inequalities, accessible transit, and affordable housing) which are 
          integral components of climate resilience. By combining expertise and resources, 
          we can work towards creating a more equity and sustainable future for marginalized 
          and vulnerable urban communities. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Government Agencies</h2>
          <p>
          Collaboration with Government Agencies is crucial for implementing last change, 
          and CRC is committed to working hand-in-hand with agencies focused on urban development, 
          climate action and community well-being. Through effective collaboration with government 
          bodies, we can bridge the gap between top-down climate plans and grassroot actions as well 
          as foster a more resilient and just society by supporting and strengthening the implementation 
          of climate plans.
          </p>

          <h2>Academic Groups</h2>
          <p>
          The academic community plays a pivotal role in advancing knowledge and innovation. 
          Through collaboration with academic institutions, CRC can ensure that our approach 
          and tools are based on robust research and appropriate methodologies. By engaging 
          with academic groups, we seek to foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation 
          with communities, laying the foundation of sustainable resilience. 
          </p>

          <h2>Community Groups</h2>
          <p>
          Central to the mission of Climate Resilient Communities is the collaboration 
          with local Community Groups who serve as catalysts for change. Our project 
          facilitates the building of community networks, connecting diverse groups 
          facing similar climate vulnerabilities. Through peer learning and collaboration, 
          communities can share insights, strategies, and experiences, enhancing 
          collective resilience. Together with Community Groups, CRC is dedicated to 
          creating a bottom-up approach that ensures the sustainability and effectiveness 
          of climate resilience efforts.
